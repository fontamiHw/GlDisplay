The following project is based on the Arduino library called "glcd", and it is available at this URL:
http://code.google.com/p/glcd-arduino/downloads/detail?name=glcd-20110423.zip&can=2&q=

and the other arduino Library "Time" avaiable on playground:
http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/Time

The wiring must be follow the table on page 3 of the document "GLCD_Documentation.pdf".
But it is possible to do another wiring considering that 
DATA pin must be on the same AVR port 
Command pin must be on another same port.


Eclipse setting:
Import the eclipseCompileSetting.xml configuration file and adapt the directories.
